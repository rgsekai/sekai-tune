/**
 * Publishes what is playing to Discord as a Rich Presence activity.
 *
 * Two routes, and the desktop gets the good one Android cannot have.
 *
 * **The local socket, preferred.** A Discord client running on this machine
 * listens on a named pipe, and an application sets a presence through it with
 * nothing but its own application id — no token, no login, no impersonation.
 * That is Discord's official Rich Presence mechanism and what every desktop
 * application uses. Android has no such client to talk to, which is the whole
 * reason its implementation looks the way it does.
 *
 * **The account gateway, as a fallback.** Android's route, ported: sign in as
 * the account and speak the client's own protocol, because on a phone there is
 * nothing else. It stays here for the case the socket cannot cover — Discord
 * not running locally, or running somewhere else — and it is offered the way
 * Android offers it, as the alternative rather than the front door, because it
 * hands an app full account access and account automation is against Discord's
 * terms.
