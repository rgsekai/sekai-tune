/**
 * A flanger used only during a smart Automix transition. A short delay — half to a few
 * milliseconds — is swept up and down by a slow oscillator and fed back on itself; the modulated
 * copy is returned wet for the engine to mix under the outgoing track, so its tail shimmers and
 * widens as it hands over to the incoming one. The two channels sweep a quarter-cycle apart, so
 * the pair opens up rather than pumping as one. The single ring is interleaved by channel, exactly
 * as [DesktopTransitionEcho]'s is.
