/**
 * A beat-synced slice repeater — the "beat roll" — used only during a planned Automix transition.
 *
 * Before [latch] it records the outgoing stream into a ring exactly one slice long (a 1/4 or 1/8 of
 * a beat, sized by the caller). [latch] freezes that ring and replays it, each pass quieter than the
 * last, so the outgoing track rolls into the handoff instead of simply fading. The per-sample
 * contract mirrors [DesktopTransitionEcho]: [wet] carries the frozen repeats, [dry] the live
 * signal, and the engine ramps one down as it ramps the other up.
